# machine_learning_trading_bot
ML fuelled algorithm for generating trade-signals.


## Background

In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Features and Implementation - Vision and Results:

You’ll combine your new algorithmic trading skills with your existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.

In a Jupyter notebook, you’ll do the following:

    - Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

    - Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

    - Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

As part of your GitHub repository’s README.md file, you will also create a report that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.

## Instructions 

Use the starter code file to complete the steps that the instructions outline. The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    -  Establish a Baseline Performance

    - Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

    - Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

    - Create an Evaluation Report


## Technologies

This Project utilizes Jupyter notebook, where the user may interact with the project and view the algorithm aswell as the machine learning capabilities. Jupyter notebook allows for a combination of markdown text blocks and python code, to allow for an organized and easy-to read final project. 

**Required Libraries:**

Key libraries used in the project :

    - [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)    
     pandas is used to interact with data packages, plot data frames, create new dataframes, describe abailable data, and helps traders and fintech proffesionals organize financial data to perform advanced decisionmaking. 

    - [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
     TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

    - [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
     scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

    
## Usage

This application can be accessed by accessing google colab, by connecting the repository file on your local computer to your google Drive account, you can access the Google Colab notebook.




# Evaluation Report


### Instructions :
